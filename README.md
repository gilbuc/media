The Media Bludit Plugin adds a feature-rich Media & File Manager to your Bludit Website.

You can use **Media** directly on its own custom administration page, but it also takes over the
known "Images" popup on the content creation view. So you don't need to switch between your browser
tabs to directly insert your files (the **Media** Plugin supports Audio & Video files too).

Features
--------
-   **Walk** smoothly through your upload directories
-   **Revise**, **Rename** and **Delete** your stuff quickly
-   **Embed** your files seamless while editing your posts...
    -   ...with support for **Image**, **Video** & **Audio** files
-   *[COMING]* Automatic **Thumbnail** Creation (with adaptable size)
-   *[COMING]* A better and configurable way to **Insert** your files
